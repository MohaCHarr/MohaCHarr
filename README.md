## About

I’m a security student focused on **penetration testing**, **Active Directory exploitation** and **Web Exploitation**.
My work blends **hands-on lab practice** with **custom tool development** — from post-exploitation frameworks to hardware hacking experiments.

Currently expanding my skill set through advanced lab environments, capture-the-flag challenges, and real-world simulation exercises.
